You can read more about it on my blog post "[Automating my development machine installation ](https://laurentkempe.com/2018/06/01/Automating-development-machine-installation/)"

Some script part were taken from [Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts)
